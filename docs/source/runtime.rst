Cloud Provider Support (Deprecated)
====================================

Sections below are instructions on running torchelastic on Kubernetes and
various cloud providers.

.. warning:: The instructions below will only work on torchelastic ``0.1.0rc``.
             We highly encourage you to use our kubernetes
             `elastic job controller <kubernetes.html>`_ and use a kubernetes
             cluster setup on your preferred cloud provider.
